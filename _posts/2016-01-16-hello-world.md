Hello World!

After delaying this I've finally came about to make this static github page a thing. Welcome!

If you may allow me, let me test some stuff:


```haskell

factorial :: (Integral a) => a -> a  
factorial 0 = 1  
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)

```

```python

(print x for x in list if x is not None)

```

```java
    SomeClassBuilderImpl someUselessBuilder = new SomeClassBuilderImpl();
    SomeClass someOtherClass = someUselessBuilder.build();
```
